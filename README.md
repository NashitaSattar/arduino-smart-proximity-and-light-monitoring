# Arduino Smart Proximity and Light Monitoring System
An autonomous Arduino-based embedded system that monitors real-time distance and ambient light levels using an ultrasonic sensor and photoresistor. The system provides visual feedback via an LCD and LEDs, and allows user interaction through an IR remote, EEPROM-based settings, and a pushbutton interface.
